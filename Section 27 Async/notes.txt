call stack is the mechanism that JS keeps track
of where it is in a bunch of function calls. 
which function it is using and what functions are
inside the current function

Works on a LIFO (Last in first out) model. Imagine
stacking plates one after another. The plate you
added last will be the first plate picked up
or used.
